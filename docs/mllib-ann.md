# Introduction

This document describes the MLlib's Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implementation.

The implementation currently consist of the following files:

* 'ArtificialNeuralNetwork.scala': implements the ANN
* 'ANNSuite': implements automated tests for the ANN and its gradient
* 'ANNDemo': a demo that approximates three functions and shows a graphical representation of
the result

# Summary of usage

The "ArtificialNeuralNetwork" object is used as an interface to the neural network. It is
called as follows:

```
val annModel = ArtificialNeuralNetwork.train(rdd, hiddenLayersTopology, maxNumIterations)
```

where

* `rdd` is an RDD of type (Vector,Vector), the first element containing the input vector and
the second the associated output vector.
* `hiddenLayersTopology` is an array of integers (Array[Int]), which contains the number of
nodes per hidden layer, starting with the layer that takes inputs from the input layer, and
finishing with the layer that outputs to the output layer. The bias nodes are not counted.
* `maxNumIterations` is an upper bound to the number of iterations to be performed.
* `ANNmodel` contains the trained ANN parameters, and can be used to calculated the ANNs
approximation to arbitrary input values.

The approximations can be calculated as follows:

```
val v_out = annModel.predict(v_in)
```

where v_in is either a Vector or an RDD of Vectors, and v_out respectively a Vector or RDD of
(Vector,Vector) pairs, corresponding to input and output values.

Further details and other calling options will be elaborated upon below.

INPUT LAYER      HIDDEN LAYER    OUTPUT LAYER
```

The i-th node in layer l is denoted by N_{i,l}, both i and l starting with 0. The weight
between node i in layer l-1 and node j in layer l is denoted by Wijl. Layer 0 is the input
layer, whereas layer L is the output layer.

The ANN also implements bias units. These are nodes that always output the value -1. The bias
units are in all layers except the output layer. They act similar to other nodes, but do not
have input.

The value of node N_{j,l} is calculated  as follows:

`$N_{j,l} = g( \sum_{i=0}^{topology_l} W_{i,j,l)*N_{i,l-1} )$`

Where g is the sigmoid function

`$g(t) = \frac{e^{\beta t} }{1+e^{\beta t}}$`

# LBFGS

MLlib's ANN implementation uses the LBFGS optimisation algorithm for training. It minimises the
following error function:

`$E = \sum_{k=0}^{K-1} (N_{k,L} - Y_k)^2$`

where Y_k is the target output given inputs N_{0,0} ... N_{I-1,0}.

# Implementation Details

## The "ArtificialNeuralNetwork" class

The "ArtificialNeuralNetwork" class has the following constructor:

```
class ArtificialNeuralNetwork private(topology: Array[Int], maxNumIterations: Int,
convergenceTol: Double)
```

* `topology` is an array of integers indicating then number of nodes per layer. For example, if
"topology" holds (3, 5, 1), it means that there are three input nodes, five nodes in a single
hidden layer and 1 output node.
* `maxNumIterations` indicates the number of iterations after which the LBFGS algorithm must
have stopped.
* `convergenceTol` indicates the acceptable error, and if reached the LBFGS algorithm will
stop. A lower value of "convergenceTol" will give a higher precision.

## The "ArtificialNeuralNetwork" object

The object "ArtificialNeuralNetwork" is the interface to the "ArtificialNeuralNetwork" class.
The object contains the training function. There are six different instances of the training
function, each for use with different parameters. All take as the first parameter the RDD
"input", which contains pairs of input and output vectors.

In addition, there are three functions for generating random weights. Two take a fixed seed,
which is useful for testing if one wants to start with the same weights in every test.

* `def train(trainingRDD: RDD[(Vector, Vector)], hiddenLayersTopology: Array[Int], maxNumIterations:
Int): ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel`: starts training with random initial weights, and a default
convergenceTol=1e-4.
* `def train(trainingRDD: RDD[(Vector, Vector)], model: ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel,
maxNumIterations: Int): ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel`: resumes training given an earlier
calculated model, and a default convergenceTol=1e-4.
* `def train(trainingRDD: RDD[(Vector,Vector)], hiddenLayersTopology: Array[Int],
initialWeights: Vector, maxNumIterations: Int): ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel`: Trains an ANN
with given initial weights, and a default convergenceTol=1e-4.
* `def train(trainingRDD: RDD[(Vector, Vector)], hiddenLayersTopology: Array[Int], maxNumIterations:
Int, convergenceTol: Double): ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel`: starts training with random
initial weights. Allows setting a customised "convergenceTol".
* `def train(trainingRDD: RDD[(Vector, Vector)], model: ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel,
maxNumIterations: Int, convergenceTol: Double): ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel`: resumes training
given an earlier calculated model. Allows setting a customised "convergenceTol".
* `def train(trainingRDD: RDD[(Vector,Vector)], hiddenLayersTopology: Array[Int],
initialWeights: Vector, maxNumIterations: Int, convergenceTol: Double): 
ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel`: Trains an ANN with given initial weights. Allows setting a
customised "convergenceTol".
* `def randomWeights(trainingRDD: RDD[(Vector,Vector)], hiddenLayersTopology: Array[Int]):
Vector`: Generates a random weights vector.
*`def randomWeights(trainingRDD: RDD[(Vector,Vector)], hiddenLayersTopology: Array[Int],
seed: Int): Vector`: Generates a random weights vector with given seed.
*`def randomWeights(inputLayerSize: Int, outputLayerSize: Int, hiddenLayersTopology: Array[Int],
seed: Int): Vector`: Generates a random weights vector, using given random seed, input layer
size, hidden layers topology and output layer size.

Notice that the "hiddenLayersTopology" differs from the "topology" array. The
"hiddenLayersTopology" does not include the number of nodes in the input and output layers. The
number of nodes in input and output layers is calculated from the first element of the training
RDD. For example, the "topology" array (3, 5, 7, 1) would have a "hiddenLayersTopology" (5, 7),
the values 3 and 1 are deduced from the training data. The rationale for having these different
arrays is that future methods may have a different mapping between input values and input nodes
or output values and output nodes.

## The "ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel" class

All training functions return the trained ANN using the class "ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel".
This class has the following function:

* `predict(testData: Vector): Vector` calculates the output vector given input vector
"testData".
* `predict(testData: RDD[Vector]): RDD[(Vector,Vector)]` returns (input, output) vector pairs,
using input vector pairs in "testData".

The weights used by "predict" come from the model.

## Training

We have chosen to implement the ANN with LBFGS as optimiser function. We compared it with
Statistical Gradient Descent. LBGFS was much faster, but in accordance is also earlier with
overfitting.

Science has provided many different strategies to train an ANN. Hence it is important that the
optimising functions in MLlib's ANN are interchangeable. A new optimisation strategy can be
implemented by creating a new class descending from ArtificialNeuralNetwork, and replacing the
optimiser, updater and possibly gradient as required.

# Demo and tests

Usage of MLlib's ANN is demonstrated through the "ANNDemo" demo program. The program generates
three functions:

* f2d: x -> y
* f3d: (x,y) -> z
* f4d: t -> (x,y,z)

It will calculate approximations of the target functions, and show a graphical representation
of the training set and the results after applying the testing set.

In addition, there are the following automated tests:

* "ANN learns XOR function": tests that the ANN can properly approximate an XOR function.
* "Gradient of ANN": tests that the output of the ANN gradient is roughly equal to an
approximated gradient.

# Conclusion

The "ArtificialNeuralNetwork" class implements a Artificial Neural Network (ANN), using the
LBFGS algorithm. It takes as input an RDD of input/output values of type "(Vector,Vector)", and
returns an object of type "ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel" containing the parameters of the
trained ANN. The "ArtificialNeuralNetworkModel" object can also be used to calculate results
after training.

The training of an ANN can be interrupted and later continued, allowing intermediate inspection
of the results.

A demo program and tests for ANN are provided.
